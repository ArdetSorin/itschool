public class Maze {

    /*
    Consider a simple maze represented by a 2D grid. The maze consists of open cells, walls, a start, and an end.
    You have to find a path from the start to the end, moving only up, down, left, or right. You can't move
    diagonally. If a path exists, print it; otherwise, inform the user that there's no solution.

    The maze will be represented by a 2D array where:
    0 represents an open cell.
    1 represents a wall.
    S represents the start.
    E represents the end.

    Example:
    S 1 0 1
    0 1 0 1
    0 1 0 1
    1 0 0 E

    Problem Tasks:
    Read the maze layout from a file or hard-code it into your program.
    Implement a pathfinding algorithm to navigate from start to the end.
    If a path is found, print the maze with the path. You can represent the path wit a *.
    If no path exists, print "No solution found.".
